How many layers
3X3 Convolution
Receptive Field
Batch Normalization
MaxPooling
Position of Max pooling
Concept of Transition Layers
Position of Transition Layer
Dropouts
1X1 Convolution
SoftMax
Kernels and how do we decide the number of kernels?
Adam vs SGD
Learning Rate
LR schedule and concept behind it
How do we know our network is not going well, comparatively, very early
When do we introduce DropOut, or when do we know we have some overfitting
Batch size and effects of batch size
When to add validation checks
Number of Epochs and when to increase them
The distance of MaxPooling from Prediction
The distance of Batch Normalization from Prediction
When do we stop convolutions and go ahead with a larger kernel or some other alternative
